Package cache implements many kinds of caching policies.

Cache replacement algorithms currently implemented:

	FIFO: first-in first-out
	LFU: least-frequently used
	LIFO: last-in first-out
	LRU: least-recently used
	MRU: most-recently used
	RR: random-replacement

They all operate in constant time, with the exception of the Dump function which
has a runtime of O(n) where n is the size of the cache.
